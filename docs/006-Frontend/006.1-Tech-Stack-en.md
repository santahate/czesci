## Purpose
> Define core technologies on the client side to align development standards across the team.

## Context
The project favours lightweight, progressively-enhanced pages rendered by Django. We therefore choose tools that minimise JavaScript bundle size while still enabling rich interactions.

## Solution
- **Tailwind CSS v4** – utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI styling; configured with JIT mode for minimal build size.
- **htmx** – handles AJAX, WebSocket and SSE requests declaratively, enabling dynamic partial updates without SPA overhead.
- **Alpine.js (v3)** – lightweight reactive layer for small stateful components (dropdowns, modals) where htmx alone is insufficient.
- **htmx-toaster** – global toast handler integrated with htmx via `HX-Trigger`, also callable from plain JS; zero CSS by default.
- **Vite** – build tool to compile Tailwind, transpile modern JS, provide HMR in development.
- **ESLint + Prettier** – code quality and formatting.

## Open Questions
1. Need for TypeScript or stay with vanilla ES modules?  
2. Consider using `htmx/ws` extension for real-time notifications vs WebSockets via Django Channels.

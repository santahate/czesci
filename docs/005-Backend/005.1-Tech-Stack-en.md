## Purpose
> Describe core technologies used on the backend side to provide a clear reference for developers and DevOps.

## Context
Early architectural decisions define the baseline for further development, deployment and hiring. The stack below was chosen for rapid development, rich ecosystem and strong community support.

## Solution
- **Python & Django 5.2.3** – primary web framework delivering ORM, admin panel, security features and rapid CRUD development.
- **htmx** – progressive enhancement library for dynamic interactions without heavy JavaScript frameworks. Integrated with Django templates for partial page updates.
- **MySQL 8.x** – relational database used in primary environment; selected for maturity, availability in managed cloud offerings and engineers' familiarity.
- **Docker** – containerisation for local development and CI/CD.
- **Gunicorn + UvicornWorker + Nginx** – production WSGI stack.
- *(Optional, later)* **Celery + Redis** – background tasks and async workflows.

## Open Questions
1. Need of read-replica for MySQL at MVP stage?
2. Evaluate Django Channels for WebSocket notifications?

# How It Works

Zapchast.com.ua is an online marketplace that **connects** car-owners with auto-parts sellers. The workflow is intentionally simple:

1. **Submit a request** – fill in the online form providing:
   • Vehicle details (make, model, year, engine)  
   • List of required spare parts (up to **5** items per request)  
   • Your contact information
2. **Instant broadcast** – after submission, your request is automatically forwarded to **dozens** of shops and distributors registered in our system.
3. **Receive offers** – sellers who have the requested parts in stock reply with their price, delivery options and warranty terms.
4. **Choose the best deal** – compare the offers and select the seller that suits you. Sending a request **does not** oblige you to place an order; it merely helps you find the most attractive offer fast.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. How fast will sellers respond?
Most replies arrive within **one hour**, but it can take up to **24 hours** depending on the day and time of the request. Requests submitted during weekends may receive some offers immediately and the rest on the next business day.

### 3. Can I place an order directly through Zapchast.com.ua?
No. Zapchast.com.ua does **not** sell parts. We act solely as an intermediary between buyers and sellers.

### 4. Is it safe to buy via your website?
Every seller undergoes a verification process before activation, and many well-known Ukrainian suppliers operate on our platform. Nevertheless, we cannot oversee every transaction. Please verify the seller's full company name, address, contact details, and delivery/return policies before ordering.

### 5. I want to dismantle my car and sell it for parts. Can I register as a seller?
No. Only legal entities or sole proprietors engaged in wholesale or retail trade of auto parts can register as sellers.

• On the front of the dashboard, visible through the windshield.  
• On the driver-side door jamb near the lock.  
• In the vehicle registration certificate (technical passport).

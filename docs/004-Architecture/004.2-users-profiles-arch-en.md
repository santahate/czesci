# Users Module Architecture: Buyer & Seller Profiles

## Introduction
This document defines the architecture for the **users** Django application that will store additional profile information for marketplace participants. A single Django `User` instance can simultaneously possess **buyer** and **seller** roles; therefore, two distinct profile models are introduced.

* **`BuyerProfile`** – keeps dedicated contact data used when the user acts as a buyer.
* **`SellerProfile`** – extends the buyer-level data with fields required for invoicing and a free-trial indicator.

> **Update (2025-06-27):** Phone numbers are now managed by the dedicated `PhoneNumber` model. The `phone_number` columns mentioned later in this document are **legacy** and will be removed in the next iteration. See [004.2a Phone Numbers Architecture](004.2a-phone-numbers-arch-en.md) for full details.

The purpose of this document is to serve as a clear implementation guide for backend developers and reviewers.

A single Django `User` is identified *primarily* by their **phone number** (mandatory, globally unique) and *optionally* an **email address**. The tuple `(phone_number, email)` must be unique – no two accounts can share the same phone or the same e-mail.

A single Django `User` is identified by a mandatory, globally unique **phone number** and an optional, globally unique **email address**. No two user accounts may share the same phone number or email.

    User ||--|| BuyerProfile : "1:1"
    User ||--|| SellerProfile : "1:1"
    BuyerProfile {
        int id PK
        string phone_number
        string email
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }
    SellerProfile {
        int id PK
        string phone_number
        string email
        date   free_trial_until
        string company_name
        string company_nip
        string company_address_line1
        string company_address_line2
        string company_postal_code
        string company_city
        string company_region
        string company_country
        datetime created_at
        datetime updated_at
    }
```
* The **users** app lives alongside `core` in the project and depends only on `django.contrib.auth` (or `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL`).
* Both profiles use a **One-To-One** relationship to the main `User` table, ensuring uniqueness while allowing either, both, or none profiles for a user.

## Data Model Details
### Common Conventions
1. **User Identity** – the `User` table stores `phone_number` (mandatory, `unique=True`) and `email` (optional, `unique=True`, may be blank). The built-in `username` field is suppressed/unused.
2. **Timestamps** – every model inherits from an abstract `TimeStampedModel` that adds `created_at` and `updated_at` (`auto_now_add=True`, `auto_now=True`).
3. **Phone Numbers** – stored as raw strings for MVP. Later we can migrate to `django-phonenumber-field`.
4. **Email** – stored independently from the login email to support scenario where a user uses different emails for transactions.
5. **Indexes & Constraints** – the `user` field is `Unique=True`; frequently filtered fields (`phone_number`, `company_nip`) receive DB indexes.

### `BuyerProfile`
| Field | Type | Null | Notes |
|-------|------|------|-------|
| `id` | AutoField (PK) | No | |
| `user` | OneToOne → `AUTH_USER_MODEL` | No | `related_name="buyer_profile"` |
| `phone_number` | CharField(32) | No | Mandatory buyer contact phone |
| `email` | EmailField | Yes | Optional buyer contact email |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | DateTime | No | From `TimeStampedModel` |

Validation Rules:
* `phone_number` **must** be provided – enforced at model clean or form level.

### `SellerProfile`
Extends `BuyerProfile` conceptually but implemented as a separate table for clarity and to avoid nullable invoicing columns in buyer records.

| Field | Type | Null | Notes |
|-------|------|------|-------|
| `id` | AutoField (PK) | No | |
| `user` | OneToOne → `AUTH_USER_MODEL` | No | `related_name="seller_profile"` |
| `phone_number` | CharField(32) | No | Mandatory seller contact phone |
| `email` | EmailField | Yes | Optional seller contact email |
| `free_trial_until` | DateField | Yes | Free subscription period end date |
| `company_name` | CharField(128) | Yes | Legal entity name |
| `company_nip` | CharField(20) | Yes | Tax ID (NIP in PL) |
| `company_address_line1` | CharField(128) | Yes | Street + Number |
| `company_address_line2` | CharField(128) | Yes | Additional address info |
| `company_postal_code` | CharField(12) | Yes | ZIP / Postal code |
| `company_city` | CharField(64) | Yes | City |
| `company_region` | CharField(64) | Yes | State / Voivodeship |
| `company_country` | CharField(64) | Yes | ISO country name or code |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | DateTime | No | From `TimeStampedModel` |

Validation Rules:
* If **any** invoicing field is provided, **all** mandatory invoicing fields (`company_name`, `company_nip`, `company_address_line1`, `company_postal_code`, `company_city`, `company_country`) must be non-null.
* `company_nip` must match Polish NIP format: `^(\\d{10})$` or a placeholder for other locales.
* `phone_number` **must** be provided – enforced at model clean or form level.

## Project Structure Changes
```plaintext

└── czesci/
    └── users/              # NEW app (added to INSTALLED_APPS)

Add `"users"` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings/main.py`.

## User ↔ Profile Relationships & Behaviour
1. A single `User` **may** possess a `BuyerProfile`, a `SellerProfile`, or **both**. Profiles are created on demand.
2. During registration, the user selects their initial role(s). They can later activate the missing profile at any time (e.g., "Become Seller").
3. Contact data inside profiles *may differ* from the master `User` phone/email (e.g., company support number). Supplying different values is optional – when omitted, application falls back to `User` fields.
4. The `User.phone_number` and `User.email` remain globally unique across the entire system; profile-level phone/emails are not required to be unique because they are secondary contacts.

---

## Open Questions / Next Steps
1. Should we normalise address into a separate reusable model? For now we embed directly for simplicity.
2. Consider installing **django-phonenumber-field** for typed phone validation.
3. Define admin UI split (buyer/seller tabs) – out of scope for this architecture but must be included in implementation tasks.

## Definition of Done (Architectural)
- Document approved by PO & Lead Dev.
- Users app scaffolding added.
- Migrations generate without errors.
- Unit tests asserting model invariants and cross-profile independence pass.

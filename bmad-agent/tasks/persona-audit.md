# Persona Audit Task

## Purpose

Understand exactly why a persona mis-behaved or what capability gap exists and document the root cause.

## Instructions

1. **Collect Evidence**  
   - Gather conversation logs, user stories, or error reports describing the issue.  
   - Ask the user for any additional context if required.

2. **Inspect Artefacts**  
   - Open the target persona's `.md` file, associated checklists, and any linked tasks.  
   - Look for missing or conflicting guidance, tool references, or task hooks.

3. **Analyse & Document**  
   - Compare observed behaviour with the persona's principles and tasks.  
   - Identify concrete lines or sections responsible for the gap.

4. **Draft Root-Cause Note**  
   - Summarise findings in a concise note that will accompany the proposed fix.  
   - Explicitly state whether code, checklist, or config changes are needed.

## Output Deliverable

- `root-cause-note.md` appended to the working directory or returned to the user as part of the chat response.

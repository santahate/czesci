# Project Rules Structure

## General Guidelines
- All project rules must follow a strict numeric categorization.
- The rule ID defines its area of application.
- Core rules must always be loaded into the active context.

## Rule Categories

- **00\*\*** — Core Project Rules
  Must always be loaded.
  Define the project structure, workflow standards, and basic operational principles.

- **10\*\*** — Backend Rules
  Standards for backend development, API design, database usage, queue management, and asynchronous tasks.

- **20\*\*** — Frontend Rules
  Standards for frontend development, UI behavior, API interactions, styling rules, and usage of libraries or frameworks.

## Naming Conventions
- Filenames must match the rule ID and title (e.g., `0000-cursor-rules.mdc`).
- Titles should be short but descriptive.
- Tags should be consistent, lowercase, and clearly define the rule’s area (e.g., `[backend]`, `[frontend]`, `[core]`).

## Future-Proofing
*Reserved for future project scaling:*

- **30\*\*** — Infrastructure and DevOps
- **40\*\*** — Testing and QA
- **50\*\*** — Documentation and Project Management Standards

These ranges are not yet used but are reserved.

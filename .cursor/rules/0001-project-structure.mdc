Key principles:
1. Keep the project structure documentation up to date
2. Follow the established patterns when adding new components
3. Maintain clear separation between frontend and backend
4. Document all structural changes

When making changes:

Backend:
- New Django apps should be created in the backend directory
- Each app should have its own urls.py and views.py
- Register new apps in INSTALLED_APPS
- Update CORS settings if new origins are needed
- Document API endpoints in the project structure

Frontend:
- New components go in appropriate subdirectories under src/components/
- Feature-specific components should have their own directory
- Shared components go in src/components/common/
- Update routing in App.tsx for new pages
- Document new dependencies in package.json

Documentation:
- Keep PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md up to date
- Document new environment variables
- Update development setup instructions
- Maintain API documentation

Testing:
- Backend tests go in tests.py within each Django app
- Frontend tests go next to their components with .test.tsx extension

Dependencies:
- Document new Python packages in pyproject.toml
- Document new npm packages in package.json
- Keep lock files committed (uv.lock, package-lock.json)

This structure should be reviewed and updated regularly as the project evolves.

 Frontend Unit Testing

## Rule
- All frontend components and logic must be covered by unit tests.
- Tests must be written and updated **with any change** to related code.
- No changes should be considered complete without corresponding tests.

## How to Run Tests

All commands must be executed from the `frontend` directory.

### Available Commands

- **Run all tests once**:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm run test
  ```

- **Run tests in watch mode** (tests are rerun automatically when files change):
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm run test:watch
  ```

- **Run tests with code coverage report**:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm run test:coverage
  ```

## Best Practices

- Create or update tests immediately when modifying components, logic, or features.
- Keep tests small, focused, and easy to understand.
- Prefer testing behavior and output over internal implementation details.
- Regularly check the code coverage report and maintain high coverage for critical parts of the application.

# Summary

Unit testing ensures component reliability and protects against regressions. Writing and running tests must become an integral part of the development process.
